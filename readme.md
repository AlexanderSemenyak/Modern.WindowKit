# Modern.WindowKit

Modern.WindowKit is a .NET abstraction over the windowing systems of Windows/Mac/Linux.

It allows you to create native windows, draw on them, and handle input.

This is a nearly direct port from [Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia), with patches to make it independent from the rest of Avalonia.
